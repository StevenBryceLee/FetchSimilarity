# FetchSimilarity
Implements cosine similarity measurement for text on a web application

You can run this program locally with the 'uvicorn main:app --reload' command
Make sure to run in FetchSimilarity/FetchSimilarity

Requires spacy's 'en_core_web_sm' model in your environment. If I expand on this project, I will add a docker file so you don't need to download that.
